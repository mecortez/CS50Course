- JS is interpreted not compiled!
- each browser has its own JS engine:
    V8 - Chrome & Node.js 
    SpiderMonkey - Firefox
    JSCore - Safari 
    Chakra - Microsoft Edge/IE

- they implement the ECMAScript standard 


JS types 
 - dynamic typing 
 - primative types (undefined, null, boolean, number, string, symbol [new])
 - objects 

Typecasting 
    coercion - change the type 

== vs ===
    == - coerces the types 
    === - requires equivalent types
